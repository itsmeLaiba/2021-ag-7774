    <h2>Explanation:</h2>
    <p>Glasses detection is an essential component in various computer vision applications, including 
        face recognition, virtual try-on systems, and facial expression analysis. The project focuses on 
        glasses detection in computer vision and its applications in various domains. It consists of two 
        parts: identifying images with glasses and visually allocating glasses to the detected images. 
        The first part utilizes Dlib's frontal face detector to locate faces and extract facial landmarks using 
        the "faceShape.dat" model. The region of interest (ROI) around the eyes and nose bridge is 
        extracted using these landmarks. Image processing techniques, such as Gaussian blur and Canny 
        edge detection, are applied to the ROI to determine the presence or absence of glasses based on 
        the presence of white pixels (edges)</p>
